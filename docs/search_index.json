Here is a short summary of the infoboxes. (I hope that their use throughout will be self-explanatory, so you wont have to keep referring to this section!) I will attribute sources that I have adapted from in infoboxes that look like this. Interesting quotes will appear in infoboxes that look like this. Definitions of key terms will appear in infoboxes that look like this. Main points or other quick summaries will appear in infoboxes that look like this. Critical thinking questions will appear in infoboxes that look like this. I will usually not give you an answer for these questionsthey are for you to ponder! Fun facts will appear in infoboxes that look like this. 0.1.5 Contributors Team members contributing new content include, Matthew Crump, Alla Chavarga, Anjali Krishnan, Jeffrey Suzuki, and Stephen Volz. This textbook was primarily written by Matthew J. C. Crump. Jeff contributed the YouTube videos peppered throughout the textbook. All of Jeffs statistics videos are available on his Youtube channel: Statistics Video playlist. Alla, Anjali, and Stephen wrote the lab manual exercises for SPSS, JAMOVI, and Excel. Matt Crump wrote the lab manual exercises for R. Matt Crump wrote a free and copiable course website, in R Markdown. The course website also contains slide decks for the lectures. 0.1.6 Attributions Two of the chapters were adapted from Danielle Navarros wonderful (and bigger) free textbook, also licensed under the same creative commons license. The citation for that textbook is: Navarro, D. (2018). Learning statistics with R: A tutorial for psychology students and other beginners (version 0.6). The website is https://compcogscisydney.org/learning-statistics-with-r/ Chapter notes within the book are provided to indicate sections where material from Navarro was included. A short summary is here Chapter 1: Why statistics, Adapted nearly verbatim with some editorial changes from Chapters 1 and 2, Navarro, D. Chapter 4: Probability, Sampling, and Estimation, Adapted and expanded from Chapters 9 and 10, Navarro D.

In general, I thank the larger R community for all of the amazing tools they made, and for making those tools open, so that I could use them to make this thing. All of the source code for compiling the book is available in the GitHub repository for this book: https://github.com/CrumpLab/statistics In principle, anybody could fork or otherwise download this repository. Load the Rproj file in R-studio, and then compile the entire book. Then, the individual .rmd files for each chapter could be edited for content and style to better suit your needs. If you want to contribute to this version of the textbook, you could make pull requests on GitHub, or discuss issues and request on the issues tab. 0.2.1 Acknowledgments Thanks to the librarians at Brooklyn College of CUNY, especially Miriam Deutch, and Emily Fairey, for their support throughout the process. Thanks to CUNY for supporting OER development, and for the grant we received to develop this work. Thanks to Jenn Richler for letting me talk about statistics all summer long. 0.2.2 Why we did this Why write another statistics textbook, arent there already loads of those? Yes, there are. We had a couple reasons. First, we would like to make R more accessible for the undergraduate population, and we wrote this textbook around the capabilities of R. The textbook was written entirely in R-Studio, and most of the examples have associated R-code. R is not much of a focus in the textbook, but there is an introduction to using R to solve data-analysis problems in the lab manual. Many instructors still use SPSS, Excel, or newer free GUIs like JAMOVI, so we also made lab exercises for each of those as well. This is a mildly opinionated, non-traditional introduction to statistics. It acknowledges some of the major ideas from traditional frequentist approaches, and some Bayesian approaches. Much of the conceptual foundation is rooted in simulations that can be conducted in R. We use some formulas, but mostly explain things without formulas. The textbook was written with math-phobia in mind, and attempts to reduce the phobia associated with arithmetic computations. There are many things missing that should probably be added. We will do our best to add necessary things as we update the textbook. 0.2.3 Hypothes.is Hypothesis is a web-browser plug-in that lets you make comments on websites by highlighting text, and then making comments. Feel free to use hypothesis with this textbook. We will read your comments. Use Hypothes.is, an amazing tool for annotating the web. Go to Hypothes.is, and get-started Install the the add-on for chrome, or other browser Thats it, turn on Hypothes.is when you are reading this textbook, and you will see all public annotations made by anyone else.
